This is a digital clock app that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
1. Display of the current date.
2. Display of the current time in your country's time zone
3. Realtime update.
4. Ability to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats using a single button.
5. Option to toggle between two styles using a single button.
6. Saving user time format and style preferences even after leaving the website or closing the browser.
